# Hello ğŸ‘‹

ğŸ˜º Decided to make this into a template so that I can save some time when working on my future projects.

ğŸ˜¸ Template includes various sass files categorised according to their uses and some resets that I use very frequently.

ğŸ˜¹ Feel free to use this template if you like, hope you'll have a nice day ahead!
